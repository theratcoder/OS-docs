# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder contains **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** for RatOS. ADRs are short documents that capture key technical and architectural decisions, along with their context and consequences.

## 📚 What is an ADR?

An ADR answers these questions:

* **What decision was made?**
* **Why was it made?**
* **What alternatives were considered?**
* **What are the consequences of the decision?**

Each ADR is immutable: once published, it is never deleted or rewritten. If a decision changes, a new ADR supersedes the old one.

## 🗂 File Naming

* Files should be named sequentially with an identifier and short description.
* Example: `0001-handle-vs-fd.md`

---

## ✍️ ADR Template

A typical ADR includes the following sections:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: Title

## Status
Proposed / Accepted / Superseded / Rejected

## Context
Why is this decision needed? What problem does it solve?

## Decision
What was decided? Describe the solution clearly.

## Alternatives
What other options were considered? Why were they not chosen?

## Consequences
What are the impacts of this decision (positive and negative)?

## References
Links to discussions, issues, or related documents.
